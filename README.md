# income-prediction
We have to predict income of people in US whether they are below poverty line or not that is $50,000

To predict whether members of the test population would be earning below or above $50,000 based on the variables taken into account in the analysis.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount.

This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as income level in between census years. This information will help policymakers to better manage and avoid income inequality globally.

This data has been collected from a random population.

There are ~200 000 individuals in train and ~100 000 individuals in the test file.

The train & test data will be used to create a machine learning model to predict if an individual earns above 50 000 of a specific currency.

The key variables are as follows:

Age. Gender. Education. Class. Education institute. Marital status. Race. Is hispanic. Employment commitment. Unemployment reason. Employment state. Wage per hour. Is part of labor union. Working week per year. Industry code. Main Industry code. Occupation code. Main Occupation code. Total employed. Household stat. Household summary. Under 18 family. Veterans adminquestionnaire. Veteran benefit. Tax status. Gains. Losses. Stocks status. Citizenship. Migration year. Country of birth own. Country of birth father. Country of birth mother. Migration code change in msa. Migration previous sunbelt. Migration code move within registration. Migration code change in registration. Residence 1 year ago. Old residence registration. Old residence state. Importance of record. Income above limit. Based on the variables set up and the data target requirements, the analysis can be assumed to be based on 20th century American population data where the median income was about $ 50,000.

Why Predict Income?
Income prediction extracts insights from individual and population-level data as it offers the ability to forecast income levels, assess financial risks, target marketing campaigns, and inform crucial decision-making in diverse spheres. However, ethical considerations, potential biases, and data privacy concerns demand careful attention alongside its undeniable benefits.
Applications in Specific Industries:

Finance:
Credit scoring and loan approval: Predicting income to assess risk and determine loan eligibility. Fraud detection: Identifying suspicious financial activity based on income patterns.
